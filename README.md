#  ML From Scratch – furyfist :)

This repository documents my journey in building core ML algorithms **from scratch** using NumPy, and applying them using libraries like `scikit-learn`. It’s structured for clarity, depth, and real-world understanding.

## 🧭 Learning Workflow

For each algorithm:
1. ✅ Understand the **theory**: intuition, math, derivations.
2. ✅ Implement using **NumPy**: no ML libraries.
3. ✅ Apply with **scikit-learn** (or suitable lib).
4. ✅ Test on small **projects** or datasets.
5. ✅ Document learnings in Markdown.

## 📌 Getting Started

Start with:
```bash
cd 01_Linear_Regression
python linear_numpy.py
